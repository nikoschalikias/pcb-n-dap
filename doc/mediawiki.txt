==Pinout==
[[File:N-DAP-6.JPG|1000px]]
* The board has 12 pins, 6 for each side, If the board is used SWD only 3 pins for signals and 2 pins for power are needed

==Background==
LPC11U32 based CMSIS-DAP programming of ARM Cortex devices via SWD. Appears as a Disk to PC. Tested with mbed firmware.<br>
Provides '''mbed-enable''' capability and can be designed-in as an SMD component or used as external programmer/debuger.<br>

===LPC1768===
*[https://developer.mbed.org/users/chalikias/code/mbed-HDK/ '''LPC11U32-Firmware''' for communicating with LPC1768]
<br>

===LPC812===
The same as LPC1768 above<br>

===LPC1114FN28===
*Firmware to use n-DAP with the non-SMD LPC1114FN28 DIP-28 [https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Switch-Science/wiki/Firmware-LPC1114FN28 Firmware LPC1114FN28]

==Using with mbed-CLI==


* Checking the working target setup<br> 
[[File:mbed-CLI-1.JPG]]<br><br>
* compile<br>
[[File:mbed-CLI-2.JPG]]<br><br>
* After pressing [SW4+SW3], then [SW3 only], then [release SW3],CPU is in ISP mode and appears as Disk with name '''"CRP DISABLD"'''<br> 
* Remove previous firmware from CPU flash by deleting the file '''firmware.bin'''<br>
*The folder should be empty<br>
*Then just drag-drop the new compiled .bin to the mbed board. It should appear as "'''firmware.bin'''"
